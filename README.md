# tsp-prices
Retrieve Thrift Savings Plan Fund prices and save as CSV files.

The Thrift Savings Plan does not interface directly with financial management software, such as Quicken. This program downloads
a 30 day history of prices for all TSP funds, and writes them to individual CSV files that can be imported into Quicken.
